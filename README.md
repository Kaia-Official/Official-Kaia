- 👋 Hi, I’m @Official-Kaia
- 👀 I’m interested in collecting manly-perfume, travelling, doing fun activities, reading, and watching movies
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various field of programming
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate: my 4th year IT crush, though he dont know me. 
- 📫 How to reach me, add my FB account: Norcaya Pacaambung, GMAIL: pacaambungnorcaya@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: Single since birth, not a vocal type of person, I easily got obssess on the things that i find attractive,
   love the idea of marriage but not in my plan, money makes me less problematic, i hate my smile/ laugh since people think it is fake and not genuine
   and will always choose kindness over everything.
